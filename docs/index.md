features:
  - title: Zero Code Changes
    details: Applications use hashed shadow values that get transparently rewritten at runtime. No SDK, no sidecar, no code modifications required.
  - title: eBPF Powered
    details: In-kernel uprobes intercept TLS writes and replace placeholders with real secret values before transmission, with minimal overhead.
  - title: Host Filtering
    details: Restrict which destination hosts each secret can be sent to, preventing accidental or malicious exfiltration of sensitive data.
